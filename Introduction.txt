Hello Everyone,

I am Srivats Srinivasan, I am enrolled in MS in Executive Data Analytics currently working as a Software Developer for a telecom company. I love biking and traveling.

Working in the telecom sector i process / analyze through a lot of data and try to visualize it on a real time basis which helps employees make a quick and informed decision. 

The kind of information that our end users / HQ / Directors request with the data available to us always intrigued me towards Data Analytics.
In this day and age where data dominates almost everything and can provide us with factual answers makes me more and more interested in pursing data analytics.

My aim towards pursing this course is for me to gain a better understating on how to process data quickly efficiently with the help of latest tools and 
technologies available to us.

Thanks
